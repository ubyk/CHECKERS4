As a UX/UI Designer, one of the first things I would consider changing in this project is the visual hierarchy and overall layout of the game interface. Here are some specific recommendations:

Enhanced Visibility of the Board: The checkers board could be made larger or given more contrast against the background to draw users' attention immediately upon entering the game. This can enhance usability by making it clearer where interactions will occur.

Improved Button Design: The "Start New Game" button could be more prominent. Consider using a larger size, brighter color, or more distinct hover effects to indicate interactivity. Clearer labels or icons could also improve recognition.

Feedback Indicators: Provide clearer visual feedback for users during each move (e.g., highlighting the selected piece and valid moves). This could make the game more intuitive and engaging.

Player Turn Indicators: Current player status can be more visually distinct, possibly using color coding or icons to signify whose turn it is. This could reduce confusion and enhance the user experience.

Reasoning Section Layout: The reasoning display could be more integrated into the game view. Perhaps placing it closer to the board or using a pop-up/modal design to capture attention when moves are made.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the layout is responsive and looks good on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobiles). This would increase accessibility and usability for a wider audience.

Consistent Aesthetic: Maintain a consistent color scheme and font style throughout the application. This could include standardizing the tones used in buttons, game pieces, and backgrounds to create a cohesive design.

Implementing these changes could significantly enhance the user experience, making the game more enjoyable and easier to interact with.
